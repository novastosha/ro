# Rogue's Odyssey

A 2D roguelike dungeon crawler game written in Java. Uses LWJGL and OpenGL.\
**This is nothing more than a personal project that I work on in my free time.**\

*This is my first go on game development (a very bad idea btw) so code inside shouldn't be judged heavily*\
*I may have borrowed some assets from games such as Minecraft and Terraria*

# Progress
Progress is currently undocumented (except for the git commits), I have sort of a vague idea of what I should or shouldn't work on at the moment; but nothing to share, yet.
